# Lesson 7: Managing Deployments

## Overview
This lesson covers Kubernetes Deployments, which provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You'll learn how to manage the complete lifecycle of applications, including scaling, updates, and rollbacks, ensuring high availability and seamless deployments.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Deployment concepts and use cases
- Create and manage Deployments
- Perform rolling updates and rollbacks
- Configure deployment strategies
- Scale applications effectively
- Monitor and troubleshoot Deployments

## Lessons

### [7.1 Understanding Deployments](7_1_Understanding_Deployments/7_1_Understanding_Deployments.md)
- What is a Deployment?
- Deployment vs ReplicaSet vs Pod
- Deployment lifecycle
- Deployment use cases

### [7.2 Managing Deployment Scalability](7_2_Managing_Deployment_Scalability/7_2_Managing_Deployment_Scalability.md)
- Scaling Deployments
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
- Resource-based scaling
- Custom metrics for scaling

## Key Concepts
- **Rolling Updates**: Zero-downtime updates
- **Rollbacks**: Reverting to previous versions
- **Scaling**: Manual and automatic scaling
- **Readiness Probes**: Ensuring application availability
- **Resource Management**: CPU and memory allocation

## Hands-on Exercises
1. Create a basic Deployment
2. Perform a rolling update
3. Roll back to a previous version
4. Scale a Deployment manually
5. Configure auto-scaling
6. Monitor Deployment status

## Deployment Strategies
- **Recreate**: Terminate old Pods before creating new ones
- **RollingUpdate**: Gradually replace old Pods with new ones
- **Blue/Green**: Switch traffic at once
- **Canary**: Gradually shift traffic to new version

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful labels and selectors
- Configure proper resource requests and limits
- Implement readiness and liveness probes
- Set appropriate update strategies
- Use versioned container images
- Monitor Deployment status and metrics

## Common Issues and Solutions
- **Update Stuck**: Check quota, resource availability
- **Pods Not Starting**: Verify image, resources, and probes
- **Rollback Fails**: Check revision history
- **Scaling Issues**: Verify resource quotas and node capacity
