# 4.2 Using Minikube

## What is Minikube?
Minikube is an all-in-one Kubernetes solution that provides both control plane and worker node functionality in a single virtual machine. It's designed for local development and testing purposes.

## Key Features

### 1. Architecture
- Combines control plane and worker node functionality
- Can be extended with additional nodes (though not covered in CKAD)
- Runs in a virtual machine or container

### 2. Installation Options
- **Virtual Machine**
  - Requires a hypervisor (VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, etc.)
  - More resource-intensive
  - Better isolation
  
- **Container**
  - Lighter weight
  - Uses Docker or other container runtimes
  - Recommended for this course

### 3. Recommended Setup
For CKAD preparation, the recommended setup is:
- Ubuntu virtual machine (2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended)
- Minikube running in a container
- This provides isolation and prevents conflicts with your main system

## System Requirements
- **Minimum**:
  - 2 CPUs
  - 2GB of free memory
  - 20GB of free disk space
  
- **Recommended**:
  - 2+ CPUs
  - 4GB+ of free memory
  - 25GB+ of free disk space

## Benefits of Using a Dedicated VM
1. **Isolation**: Prevents conflicts with your main operating system
2. **Safety**: Easy to reset if something goes wrong
3. **Consistency**: Matches the Linux environment you'll use in the exam
4. **Clean Environment**: No conflicts with existing container runtimes

## Next Steps
- Choose your preferred installation method
- Ensure your system meets the requirements
- Proceed with the appropriate installation guide for your platform
