# Module 1: Container Fundamentals

## Overview
This module provides the essential foundation for working with containers, which is crucial for understanding Kubernetes. You'll learn about container concepts, management, and image creation, all of which are fundamental skills for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with basic system administration concepts
- Docker or another container runtime installed

## Learning Path

### [Lesson 1: Understanding and Using Containers](Lesson1_Understanding_and_Using_Containers/index.md)
- Introduction to container technology
- Container architecture and components
- Working with container registries
- Container lifecycle management
- Container logging and debugging

### [Lesson 2: Managing Container Images](Lesson2_Managing_Container_Images/index.md)
- Container image architecture
- Image tagging and versioning
- Building custom images
- Working with Dockerfile/Containerfile
- Image management best practices

## Key Concepts
- **Containers vs Virtual Machines**: Understanding the differences and use cases
- **Container Runtimes**: Docker, containerd, CRI-O
- **Container Images**: Layers, caching, and optimization
- **Image Registries**: Public and private repositories
- **Container Lifecycle**: Creation, execution, and cleanup

## Hands-on Labs
Throughout this module, you'll complete practical exercises to reinforce your learning:
1. Working with container runtimes
2. Managing container lifecycle
3. Building and optimizing container images
4. Working with image registries

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain container concepts and architecture
- Work with container runtimes effectively
- Build and manage container images
- Understand container networking and storage
- Debug common container issues

## Resources
- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [OCI Image Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)
- [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/)

## Next Steps
After completing this module, you'll be ready to move on to [Module 2: Kubernetes Essentials](../Module2_Kubernetes_Essentials/index.md), where you'll apply these container concepts in a Kubernetes environment and learn about core Kubernetes functionality.
