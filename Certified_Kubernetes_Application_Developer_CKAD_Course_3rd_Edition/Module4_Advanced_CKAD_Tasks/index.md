# Module 4: Advanced CKAD Tasks

## Overview
This module covers advanced topics essential for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. You'll learn how to troubleshoot applications, manage custom resources, implement advanced deployment strategies, and optimize your Kubernetes workloads.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of [Module 3: Building and Exposing Scalable Applications](../Module3_Building_and_Exposing_Scalable_Applications/index.md)
- Strong understanding of Kubernetes core concepts
- Experience with kubectl and YAML manifests

## Learning Path

### [Lesson 13: Advanced Application Deployment](Lesson13_Deploying_Application_the_DevOps_Way/index.md)
- Implementing blue-green deployments
- Setting up canary releases
- Working with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Managing applications with Operators
- Stateful application deployment with StatefulSets

### [Lesson 14: Troubleshooting Kubernetes](Lesson14_Troubleshooting_Kubernetes/index.md)
- Developing a troubleshooting strategy
- Analyzing failing applications
- Diagnosing pod access problems
- Monitoring cluster event logs
- Resolving authentication issues
- Implementing health checks with probes

## Key Concepts
- **Troubleshooting Methodology**: Systematic approach to diagnosing issues
- **Application Debugging**: Tools and techniques for debugging applications
- **Advanced Deployment Strategies**: Minimizing downtime during updates
- **Custom Resources**: Extending Kubernetes functionality
- **Operators**: Automating complex application management

## Hands-on Exercises
1. Debug a non-starting application
2. Troubleshoot network connectivity issues
3. Implement a canary deployment
4. Create and use a Custom Resource Definition
5. Set up a basic Operator
6. Migrate stateful applications

## Exam Focus Areas
- Application troubleshooting (40% of exam)
- Application deployment (20% of exam)
- Application design and build (20% of exam)
- Application environment, configuration, and security (20% of exam)

## Best Practices
- Always check pod events and logs first
- Use `kubectl describe` for detailed resource information
- Implement proper health checks
- Use rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments
- Document your troubleshooting steps
- Test failure scenarios in a non-production environment
