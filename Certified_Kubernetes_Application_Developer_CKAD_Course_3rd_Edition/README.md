# Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Course - 3rd Edition

## Introduction

Since its first release on July 21, 2015, Kubernetes has revolutionized the way IT infrastructure is managed. It offers a scalable way to run containers in public cloud, on-premise data centers, or even as a test environment on your own laptop.

### About Kubernetes Certifications

- **KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate)**: The entry-level certification
- **CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)**: Focuses on application deployment and management (this course)
- **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)**: Covers cluster management and operations
- **CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)**: Specialized in Kubernetes security

### About This Course

This course is a preparation for the CKAD exam, but it's also valuable for anyone who wants to master Kubernetes application deployment. I studied it and learned essential skills for running applications in Kubernetes, including:

- Container fundamentals and Kubernetes basics
- Pod management and configuration
- Application deployment and scaling
- Networking, storage, and security
- Advanced CKAD tasks and troubleshooting

Even if you're not planning to get certified, these skills are crucial for anyone working with Kubernetes in development or operations roles.
